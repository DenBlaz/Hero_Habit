            Welcome to HeroHabit!

                <p class="first_time_par">Now you are the hero of your own story, and only you decide how epic it will be.
                    There are no strict judges or dragons here (yet), just you and your real achievements</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">The rules are simple:
                    Every completed daily task gives you +5 points to the chosen attribute.
                    Stay consistent, and your hero will become a true legend!</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">Long-term tasks grant +15 points for each week required to complete the task or build a habit.
                    The bigger the goal, the greater the reward!</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">But remember: each new level gets harder.
                    The further you go, the more effort is needed to level up. Heroes aren’t made overnight!</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">Your character's level depends on all attributes.
                    The main attribute gives the biggest boost,
                    but neglecting the others can slow down your progress. Balance is the key to success!</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">Responsibility is rewarded!
                    By completing tasks diligently, you'll earn achievements that prove you're a true hero.
                    Let’s be honest, "Master of Productivity" sounds way cooler than "Wizard of Procrastination."</p>

                <p class="first_time_par">And most importantly: honesty is your superpower.
                    If your “morning yoga” was actually just scrolling memes in a lotus pose,
                    or your “evening run” was really just a walk to the fridge—be honest!
                    You can fool everyone, but not yourself. A true hero grows through real effort.</p>
